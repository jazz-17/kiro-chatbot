# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a technical support system that enables customers to describe technical issues, upload diagnostic files, and receive accurate, context-aware solutions through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The system will be implemented as a modular monolith using FastAPI backend and Vue 3 frontend, with real-time streaming responses and multi-modal file processing capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to describe my technical issues in a chat interface and receive AI-powered solutions, so that I can quickly resolve problems without waiting for human support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL perform similarity search against the vector knowledge base
2. WHEN context is retrieved from documents THEN the system SHALL construct a rich prompt for the AI provider
3. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the system SHALL stream the response back to the user in real-time using Server-Sent Events
4. WHEN the response is complete THEN the system SHALL include citations referencing the knowledge base documents used
5. IF no relevant context is found THEN the system SHALL still provide a helpful response based on general AI knowledge

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to upload diagnostic files like logs and screenshots with my questions, so that the AI can provide more accurate and context-specific solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL accept images and text-based log files
2. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL trigger a background task to process the file without blocking the API
3. WHEN processing log files THEN the system SHALL extract key information like error codes, stack traces, and relevant context
4. WHEN processing image files THEN the system SHALL use a multi-modal AI model to analyze screenshots for error messages and UI elements
5. WHEN file processing is complete THEN the extracted information SHALL be used to augment the RAG pipeline context
6. IF file processing fails THEN the system SHALL continue with the chat request and log the error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage the knowledge base by uploading and processing documents, so that the AI can provide accurate solutions based on our documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator uploads a document THEN the system SHALL chunk the document into appropriate segments
2. WHEN documents are chunked THEN the system SHALL create vector embeddings for each chunk
3. WHEN embeddings are created THEN the system SHALL store them in the PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension
4. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL make them available for similarity search
5. IF document processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain system stability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely register and login to the system, so that my conversations and data are private and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create a secure account with encrypted password storage
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL provide JWT access and refresh tokens
3. WHEN accessing protected resources THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens
4. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL provide a secure refresh mechanism
5. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL ensure all conversations and files are scoped to the authenticated user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provide my own AI provider API keys, so that I can use my preferred AI service and control my usage costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides API keys THEN the system SHALL encrypt them at rest
2. WHEN making AI requests THEN the system SHALL use the user's provided API keys if available
3. WHEN API keys are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN users haven't provided keys THEN the system SHALL fall back to default provider configuration
5. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to support multiple AI providers and vector databases through modular interfaces, so that we can easily switch or add new providers in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing AI providers THEN the system SHALL use abstract base classes for AIProvider interface
2. WHEN implementing vector databases THEN the system SHALL use abstract base classes for VectorDatabase interface
3. WHEN adding new providers THEN the system SHALL only require implementing the interface methods
4. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL provide default implementations for OpenAI and PostgreSQL with pgvector
5. IF a provider fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and potentially fall back to alternatives

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive chat interface, so that I can easily interact with the system on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the interface THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
2. WHEN viewing messages THEN the system SHALL display them in chat bubbles with proper formatting
3. WHEN messages contain Markdown THEN the system SHALL render it properly
4. WHEN responses include citations THEN the system SHALL display them as clickable references
5. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL provide a drag-and-drop interface
6. WHEN files are being processed THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time streaming responses, so that I can see the AI's answer being generated and don't have to wait for the complete response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the system SHALL stream tokens in real-time using Server-Sent Events
2. WHEN streaming responses THEN the system SHALL maintain connection stability
3. WHEN the stream completes THEN the system SHALL properly close the connection
4. IF the stream is interrupted THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully
5. WHEN multiple users are active THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent streaming sessions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the backend to be structured as a modular monolith, so that the system is maintainable while avoiding the complexity of microservices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN structuring the application THEN the system SHALL organize code into clear service modules
2. WHEN implementing business logic THEN the system SHALL delegate from thin API routers to service classes
3. WHEN handling data THEN the system SHALL use Pydantic for validation and SQLAlchemy for database operations
4. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL stream uploads directly to S3-compatible storage
5. WHEN running background tasks THEN the system SHALL use FastAPI's BackgroundTasks or Celery

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversation history to be preserved and easily accessible, so that I can reference previous interactions and solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends messages THEN the system SHALL store the conversation history
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL display their previous conversations
3. WHEN viewing conversation history THEN the system SHALL maintain the original formatting and citations
4. WHEN searching conversations THEN the system SHALL provide search functionality across message content
5. WHEN deleting conversations THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data including uploaded files

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an internal tool or enhanced logging to inspect the intermediate steps of the RAG pipeline for any given conversation, so that I can easily debug why the system gave a specific answer and fine-tune its performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a RAG request THEN the system SHALL log all intermediate steps including similarity search results, retrieved documents, and prompt construction
2. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs of vector search scores and ranking
3. WHEN inspecting conversations THEN the system SHALL provide an internal interface to view RAG pipeline details
4. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL track metrics like retrieval accuracy, response time, and token usage
5. WHEN fine-tuning the system THEN the system SHALL provide insights into which knowledge base documents are most frequently used
