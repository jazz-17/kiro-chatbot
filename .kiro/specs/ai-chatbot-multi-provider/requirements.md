# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AI chatbot application that supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) as an MVP, with architecture designed to accommodate future RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities using PostgreSQL as a vector database. The system consists of a Vue.js frontend with shadcn/ui components and TanStack Query, and a FastAPI backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from different AI providers, so that I can choose the best model for my specific needs and have flexibility in my AI interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the chatbot interface THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown or selection interface with available AI providers
2. WHEN the user selects an AI provider THEN the system SHALL persist this selection for the current session
3. IF multiple providers are configured THEN the system SHALL allow switching between providers without losing chat history
4. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL route the request to the currently selected AI provider

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have conversations with AI models, so that I can get assistance, answers, and engage in meaningful dialogue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types a message and submits it THEN the system SHALL send the message to the selected AI provider
2. WHEN the AI provider responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat interface
3. WHEN a conversation is in progress THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and history
4. IF the AI provider request fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry
5. WHEN the user starts a new conversation THEN the system SHALL clear the previous context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular provider system, so that I can easily add new AI providers without modifying existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new AI provider needs to be added THEN the system SHALL support adding it through a standardized interface
2. WHEN provider configurations change THEN the system SHALL load new configurations without requiring code changes
3. IF a provider becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the failure gracefully and inform the user
4. WHEN multiple providers are configured THEN the system SHALL manage API keys and configurations securely

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system architecture to support future RAG capabilities, so that I can add document retrieval and vector search without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database schema is designed THEN it SHALL include tables that can accommodate document storage and metadata
2. WHEN the API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL be structured to support future document upload and retrieval operations
3. IF vector search capabilities are added later THEN the current chat storage SHALL be compatible with vector embeddings
4. WHEN conversations are stored THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL with a schema that supports future vector extensions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my chat history to be preserved, so that I can reference previous conversations and maintain context across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends messages THEN the system SHALL store all conversations in the PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL load their previous chat history
3. WHEN conversations are displayed THEN they SHALL show timestamps and provider information
4. IF the user wants to delete conversations THEN the system SHALL provide options to clear chat history

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive chat interface, so that I can interact with the AI naturally across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the chat interface THEN it SHALL be responsive and work on desktop and mobile devices
2. WHEN messages are being processed THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and typing states
3. WHEN the user scrolls through chat history THEN the interface SHALL handle long conversations efficiently
4. IF the user is typing THEN the system SHALL provide a smooth and responsive input experience
5. WHEN new messages arrive THEN the chat SHALL auto-scroll to show the latest message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure AI provider settings, so that I can manage API keys, rate limits, and provider-specific options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN provider configurations are needed THEN the system SHALL support environment-based configuration management
2. WHEN API keys are stored THEN they SHALL be handled securely and not exposed in client-side code
3. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle provider-specific rate limiting gracefully
4. WHEN provider settings change THEN the system SHALL apply new configurations without requiring restart
